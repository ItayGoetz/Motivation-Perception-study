***Can we choose to see nothing over something?***

We (naturally) tend to believe that we experience the world as it is. That is, that what we see through our eyes is an accurate representation of what is out there in the environment around us. However, empirical evidence strongly suggests that that may not be the case: Visual perception is based not only on sensory but also on contextual inputs, thus under some circumstances we may see things differently to their objective appearance in the environment (Bromberg-Martin \& Sharot, 2020). For example, it has long been shown that people are likely to see what they expect to see (Kok et al., 2013; de Lange et al., 2018). 

Until recently it has been held that motivation is a mechanism that acts only to focus attention on the most relevant information. However, recent studies strongly suggest that that might not be that case, and that like the effect of expectation on perception, motivation may bias us to see what we want to see, rather than what is real (Leong et al., 2020). 
But what happens when we are motivated **not** to see something? For example, it is common wisdom that when you are asked not to think of a white bear, the first picture that jumps into your mind is of, of course, a white bear. Leong et al. (2019) have recently examined this phenomenon, reporting that when people are shown an unclear picture and are motivated not to see a certain stimulus (i.e., a face) in it, they are indeed more likely to see a competing stimulus (i.e., a house) instead of it. 

However, the question that remains open is whether in such cases people repress the representation of the stimuli they are motivated not to see, or whether they “push” the representation of the competing stimulus over the unwanted stimulus. In this case the effect might simply be that of motivation on perception that is already known to us. 
In order to account for this question and better understand the mechanisms behind unmotivated seeing, we conduct the current study. Participants will be motivated not to see certain stimuli, but they will not get the opportunity to “push” any other stimuli instead of it (that is where we differ from the Leong et al. 2019 study). 
In other words, we ask whether people can push the representation of nothing, over something.
